# 18S Barcoding in Wild Canid Respiratory Microbiome

## Group Members

## Background (work in progress)
- My data is not linked to a published research paper -- it comes from an ongoing research project seeking to characterize the respiratory microbiome of canids (wild and domestic) presenting with respiratory disease. A proposal for the study was submitted to the American Kennel Club, who has agreed to sponsor the project. Currently, the main focus of the research team is to characterize a novel respiratory mycoplasma suspected to induce respiratory disease in domestic canines; in the proposal, the primary pathogen of interest is referred to as "BARDID" (Bacteria Associated with Respiratory Disease In Dogs). Aside from characterizing BARDID, a secondary goal of the research team is to broadly describe the respiratory microbiome in canids; to this end, they have performed 16s and 18s barcoding to understand the composition of the respiratory microbiome of cainds. The majority of samples being tested are from domestic canines (canis familiaris), but respiratory tissue samples from the NHVDL biobank have also been included in order to explore the respiratory microbiomes of other canids -- specifically wild canids (i.e. canis latrans, canis lupus).
- Title of proposal: Characterizing potential novel CIRD pathogen and CIRD microbiome perturbations 
- Chief investigator: David Needle, DVM DVCAP
- My dataset includes fastqs from 6 wild canids and 1 domestic dog for whom PCR amplification has been performed with the NF1F 18s primer, followed by sequencing in illumina with a read length of (250bp?) 
- Goal: 18S barcoding to identify the eukaryotic pathogens in wild canids (red fox, grey fox, coyote) and compare this to the eukaryotic pathogens in my (single) canine sample

## Methods (work in progress)
- use cutadapt to trim and DADA2 to merge paired-end reads (done)
- later, local alignment and the creation of bar graphs to demonstrate species quanitity and distribution based on # of barcodes 

### Tools:
#### Cutadapt
- ... step completed, see script


#### DADA2
- ... step completed, see script

## Script (so far)
- (it's in Ron right now. Probably shouldn't paste it here)
